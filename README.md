# Heavens Ablaze 
### Climb in your spacefigher and start shooting your friends!*


This was my first release ever. I learned a lot about coding, game design, the importance of project organization, and networking issues. Lots of networking issues. I made this game because there weren't any quality multiplayer spacefighter sims in my price range. The one I did have (Starfighter Arduxim, available on Steam) didn't keep ship momentum, leading to a clunky experience. I didn't like that so I said, "hey, you could make your own. And if you did, you could make it any way you want!" So I did.

I have another project in the works (as of 7/26/2024), which will be available on itch.io when it is completed. The source code, however, can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SumRbrandR/MoonstruckTower).
