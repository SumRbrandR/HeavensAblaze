# Heavens Ablaze

Climb in your spacefigher and start shooting your friends!*
*Friends not included.

This was my first release ever. I learned a lot about coding, game design, project organization, and networking issues. Lots of networking issues. 
I made this game because there weren't any quality multiplayer spacefighter sims in my price range. The one I did have (Starfighter Arduxim, available on Steam) didn't keep ship momentum, leading to a clunky experience. I didn't like that so I said, "hey, you could make your own. And if you did, you could make it any way you want!" So I did.

I also made this game because I wanted to get into game development. I'm a huge fan of games and wanted to take a shot at it. Although it's certainly not perfect (known issues include ships moving sparatically if rotated very quickly, and the damage hologram is inaccurate when the supporting wing is destroyed by itself), I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.
